description         Project Management beyond Gantt Chart Drawing
long_description \
  TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful, Free and Open Source Software project \
  management tool. Its new approach to project planning and tracking is more \
  flexible and superior to the commonly used Gantt chart editing tools. \
  \
  TaskJuggler is project management software for serious project managers. It \
  covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the first idea \
  to the completion of the project. It assists you during project scoping, \
  resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk and communication \
  management.\
  \
  TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your project time \
  lines and resource assignments based on the project outline and the \
  constraints that you have provided. The built-in resource balancer and \
  consistency checker offload you from having to worry about irrelevant details\
  and ring the alarm if the project gets out of hand. The flexible \
  as-many-details-as-necessary approach allows you to plan your project as you \
  go, making it also ideal for new management strategies such as Extreme \
  Programming and Agile Project Management. \
  \
  If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together the \
  release schedule of your open source project, TaskJuggler is the right tool \
  for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt charts to impress your \
  boss or your investors, TaskJuggler might not be right for you. You can of \
  course create nice looking Gantt charts. But it takes a little more effort \
  to master its power. If you are up for this, TaskJuggler will become a \
  companion that you don't want to miss anymore.
