long_description    Timewarrior tracks and reports time. \
                    Timewarrior is a command line time tracking application, which \
                    allows you to record time spent on activities. You may be tracking \
                    your time for curiosity, or because your work requires it. At its \
                    simplest, you tell it to start and stop tracking time.
